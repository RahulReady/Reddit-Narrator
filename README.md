## **Motivation:**

A while back, I came across a couple of 'Ask Reddit' videos where people took screenshots of interesting questions and replies on the 'Ask Reddit' subreddit.

Just as a fun challenge, I wanted to try to automate these videos.

## **Results:**

Co-created a Youtube channel with the results of the script:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFG7fbuz3noaXS56ZR3cxg/videos

## **Tools Used:**

- Selenium
- MoviePy
- Pyttsx
- Github
- Youtube channel analytics

## **Skills Utilized:**

- Project Management
- Software Engineering
- Marketing
- Business
- Entrepreneurship

## **Process:**

1. Created a baseline script using Selenium, moviepy, and pyttsx.
2. Hired a freelancer to add feature functionality such as the partial screenshots.
3. Hired a Youtube SEO optimization expert, created a Youtube advertising campaign, and coordinated with a Youtube marketing specialist to try and increase channel visibility.

## **Possible Next Steps:**

- Blur/censor swear words
- Automate thumbnails
- Create a cron job to automate running the script every day
- Adjust text that's too big to fit on a single screen
